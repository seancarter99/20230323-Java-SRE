WHAT IS UNIT TESTING?

- Unit testing is the idea of writing tests for individual pieces of code (units)
	- units can be methods, constructors, etc.
- we should attempt to "break" the code however possible to meet our quality criteria
- we should also strive for 100% code coverage
	- not always possible, but that's the goal
- try to test "edge cases" -- null values, large/small numbers, prime numbers, min/max values, empty Strings


TDD -- Test-Driven Development
- in test-driven development, we're writing test immediately after writing code
- OR, quite often, writing tests BEFORE we write the code
- this ensures that code is written carefully and that the developer is anticipating the potential problems


JUNIT -- Java Unit Testing
- the most widely-used library for Java testing
- you can write individual tests for various functions
- you can use setup/breakdown to create/remove resources before/after your tests
